# Consumer-price-index-of-golf
A project about the time series analysis and consumer price index of the price of gold in Uk from 1980-2020
The project was about studying the gold prices and consumer price
index of the UK. I did a time series analysis of the gold prices and fit a
regression line through the scatter plot of the gold prices to
understand its rise and drop throughout the years 1980-2020. This
project was done in Python with the help of a senior.
